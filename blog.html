<h1 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 3em">Tips for living in your first off-campus Apartment</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p> I used to live in the apartment during my graduation time. It was a great experience living there with your high school friends 

I was more than happy to pitch the idea of moving into an apartment to my parents for my sophomore year of college. Since my older cousin had been allowed the same privilege, I figured it would be easy for me to get my way. My parents were reluctant to pay over 5000 for rent, yet I needed a place that was a good size, that offered me my bedroom and, of course, a kitchen.



Since moving into my first apartment, I've been more than dismayed at the lack of amenities and service my living space has allotted to me. Where I was expecting a revitalized, cozy nest, I was met with pests and broken appliances.



I was once in a position of uncertainty about where to live my second year of college, so to ease the burden to future apartment dwellers looking for a fancy new pad, here’s a list of 25 things you should do/know before moving into your first college apartment. 

<br>
<br>

 1 .   Don’t base your opinion of the apartment complex off of the model they show you during your tour. Talk to people who have lived there before you and get their opinions before you sign the lease.
<br>
<br>
2 .  Try to live with your old friends for better understanding
<br>
<br>
3 .  Grocery shop in bulk. Buy a bunch of meats, separate them and freeze them so you’ll have dinner ideas prepared.
<br>
<br>
4 .   Write down and photograph everything wrong with the apartment as soon as you move in. That way, you won’t be charged for property damage when it’s time for you to leave.
<br>
<br>
5 .   Get to know your neighbors.
<br>
<br>
6 .   Use "splitwise" app to share the expenses occured by each member.
<br>
<br>
7 .   Your parents will probably get you a bunch of cleaning supplies for your apartment — use them.
<br>
<br>
8 .   Remember what grocery items you bought. And if something of yours goes missing, don’t be afraid to nicely confront your roommates about it.
<br>
<br>
9 .   Use the maintenance request forms whenever needed. Don’t be afraid that you’ll bother your complex management. Paying 5000 a month for rent means 500 reasons everything in your apartment should be perfect.
<br>
<br>
10 .   Don’t forget to pay your rent — those late fees can be a killer.
<br>
<br>
11 .   Call your apartment complex prior to move-in and ask if there’s anything that doesn’t come with the apartment that you might need to purchase individually, such as a shower rod, router, nightstand, etc.
<br>
<br>
12 .   Buy a mattress pad.
<br>
<br>
13 .   Utilize your kitchen.
<br>
<br>
14 .   If you throw a house-warming party or kickback at your place, be prepared to clean up the leftover mess.
<br>
<br>
15 .   Decorate!
<br>
<br>
16 .   Off-campus living means no RA’s checking in on you every few days. Be sure to use your freedom wisely.
<br>
<br>
17 .   Always make sure you have food at your place.
<br>
<br>
18. Lock your bedroom door before leaving your apartment.
<br>
<br>
19 .   Don’t share your WiFi password with too many people.
<br>
<br>
20 .   Doing laundry becomes a blessing when you don’t have to worry about collecting quarters to use a machine.
<br>
<br>
21 .   Don’t forget to change your local address to your new residency. I sometimes still get mail from the girl who lived in this apartment before me.
<br>
<br>
22 .   Utilize whatever facilities your complex has to offer — pool, gym, tanning beds.
<br>
<br>
23 .   Make sure your apartment comes furnished.
<br>
<br>
24 .   Keeping a mini-fridge in your room isn’t such a bad investment.
<br>
<br>
25 .   If you plan on inviting more than three guests over, tell your roommates.
<br>
<br>

Take it from me, neither dorm living nor apartment living has to be something viewed negatively. Doing your research prior to making any move-in promises will not only save you time and money, but also save you from further complications and allow for a smoother transition into your new residence.Overall you are going to have a great experience of how to manage things of daily life n real world and Going to have some great memories with your friends.
